# C-  Hashmap Opaque Object
After completing Computing 2 - Data Structures in C at UMass Lowell, I wanted to attempt to create my own implementation of a data structure that was not covered in the course.

I've also included the files for my own implementation of a String opaque object as it is used by the main.c demo file.
